# 24-Volume Curriculum Roadmap

This roadmap is the authoritative plan for the Enterprise Infrastructure
Encyclopedia: approved titles, stable slugs, scope, and chapter counts for
all 24 volumes. Dependencies are noted where a volume assumes prior volumes
as prerequisite reading.

## Ownership and scope control

- Each volume advances only after the prior volume in its dependency chain
  has passed the completed-volume gate defined in `book.yml`.
- Vendor-specific volumes (III, V, XIV–XXIII) are scoped to the dated baseline
  in [SOFTWARE_VERSIONS.md](SOFTWARE_VERSIONS.md) and must be revisited when that
  baseline changes materially.
- [PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md) tracks technical review and
  lab-validation sign-off against this roadmap.
